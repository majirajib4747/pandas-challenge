UPenn Data Science Boot Camp panda challenge
I had devided this Problem into 6 part 
In 1st Part I had calculated Overall Summry and displayed in the Terminal
In 2nd Part I had calculated School wise Summary and displayed the dataframe
In 3rd part is over all grade wise summary 
In 4th , 5th and 6th - I had calculated school by pending , school by size and school by type - these 3 parts are very similar. Only the group by fields are different.
