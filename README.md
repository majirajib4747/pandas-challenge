UPenn Data Science Boot Camp panda challenge
I had devided this Problem into 6 part 
In 1st Part I had calculated Overall Summry and displayed in the Terminal
In 2nd Part I had calculated School wise Summary and displayed the dataframe
In 3rd part is over all grade wise summary 
In 4th , 5th and 6th - I had calculated school by pending , school by size and school by type - these 3 parts are very similar. Only the group by fields are different. 


# Module 5 Panda , Pyplot data Visualization Challenge 
In 1st part I had read the CSV into Landa Dataframe and manipulate Data like removed Duplicates. 
In 2nd Part calculated statistical Info ( Mean , median , Variance , Standard Daviation and SEM ) from that dataframe based on Drug Regimen 
In 3rd Part draw Bar and Pie Chart using Panda dn Pylot. Bar Chart is for Based on Drug and # of observed Mouse Timepoints. 
Pie Chart is based on Sex and Nos of Mouse( % ) 
in 4th Section calculated Quartiles , Outliers for 4 drug regimen - Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
At the end of 4th Section created teh Box Plot Chart for those 4 drug regimen 
5th Section , I had drew a Line Chart for a Mosuse ID ( s185) and showed the progress of tumor volume with Capomulin, As per the line chart - Tumor Volume decreased over the Period. 
6th Section - I had built scatter Plot which shows Mouse weight ( g) and average tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen. It is clear that - If the weight is higher , then tumor volume is higher too. I had used seaborn python package for this exercise. 
6th Section , I had calculated the correlation coefficient and a linear regression model for mouse weight and observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen. correlation coefficient value for entire Capomulin regimen came up .95. I had used altair python Package for this exercise. I had install this package in Anaconda Location ( pip install altair )
